Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?

  There were not any that I could think of? Only sub-optimal thing was probably the styling (UI) as I did not have enought time to think of a nice interface


Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
  I probably included more components than I needed. I could've just dont one or two but I chose to do several

If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
 Probably include cloud architecture and also enchance the secuirty of the network
What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
I will create more graphical information like live charts, marketcap, etc. To educate if it's even a good time to buy or sell.
